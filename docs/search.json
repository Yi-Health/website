Data show that over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010, the global incidence of dengue increased approximately 30-fold.

    "text": "Dengue Fever Prevention and Control System Technical Plan in Yunnan\n\nOverview\n\nThe successful implementation of the Mo-Buzz model in Sri Lanka and Thailand provides valuable experience for dengue fever control. This model has shown that timely identification and effective management of mosquito breeding sites are key to controlling vector-borne diseases like dengue fever. By utilizing digital tools for real-time monitoring and rapid response, the prevention and control effects have been significantly enhanced.  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), personalized, one-on-one smart Q&A is becoming a new form of information dissemination, capable of providing real-time responses and transmitting epidemic-related information. At the same time, short-video platforms like TikTok demonstrate powerful information dissemination capabilities and user engagement.  Therefore, we propose Mo-Buzz + EasyHealth AI + TikTok as an innovative technical pathway for epidemic prevention and control. This approach is applicable to dengue fever control in the Yunnan province of China, with plans to expand its use to other infectious diseases monitoring and management.  This technical pathway will connect health management agencies, public health departments, and the general public through social media, using crowdsourced data collection and AI technology for digital gathering, analysis, and dissemination of epidemic information. A series of functional modules will be developed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of information transmission while increasing community involvement, encouraging the public to participate in epidemic prevention efforts. \n\n\n\n\nSystem Architecture\n\nBased on the Mo-Buzz + EasyHealth AI + TikTok approach, we will develop an “all-in-one multi-end” application system. The system will consist of two main modules: the User-Portal and the Admin-Portal. The User-Portal will focus on data collection and health education, while the Admin-Portal will concentrate on data analysis, epidemic monitoring, and health interventions. This modular structure ensures system flexibility and scalability, improving both the response speed and accuracy of epidemic control efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMo-Buzz + AI + TikTok Technology Solution\n\n\n\nUser Portal\n\nThe User-Portal module is designed for public use, aiming to enhance public participation and data collection efficiency while providing personalized health education and information dissemination. Its specific functions are as follows: \nLocation and Reporting Function: Public users can input information via smartphones, reporting suspected mosquito breeding sites through text descriptions, photo uploads, or video recordings. The system will utilize the smartphone’s GPS functionality to log the geographical location of the submitted information. Based on the characteristics of the report, such as breeding site type, environmental conditions, and case type, the system will automatically assign tags to the data for subsequent management. \nEpidemic Information Dissemination:  Based on the user’s location, the system will automatically push nearby epidemic alerts. It will also offer personalized prevention and control knowledge based on the user’s historical behavior. The system will support health departments in publishing official announcements, ensuring timely delivery of critical information. The system will integrate with mainstream social media platforms (like WeChat and Weibo) through APIs, allowing users to log in with their social media accounts and share information quickly. The system will optimize content format and presentation based on platform characteristics to help users share epidemic control-related content, increasing public participation in epidemic prevention.\nHealth Education Smart Assistant:  Based on the GPT model, the system can understand users’ natural language inputs and provide accurate Q&A regarding prevention and control knowledge. By analyzing user data, such as geographical location, habits, and points of interest, it will build user profiles and automatically generate personalized health education content, selecting the appropriate timing and methods for pushing information. Based on the user’s health status and nearby epidemic data, it will assess the risk of epidemic transmission in the user’s area. In case of a high-risk situation, it will generate a warning and offer targeted prevention suggestions.\n\n\n\nAdmin-Portal\n\nThe Admin-Portal module is for public health observers (PHIs) and public health institutions, providing comprehensive data aggregation, analysis, and decision support to help authorities respond quickly and intervene effectively. Its specific functions are as follows:\nCrowdsourced Data Review and Confirmation: Since the information uploaded by users depends on public participation, the data quality can vary. Therefore, the system will include a data review mechanism. It will automatically verify user-submitted images, videos, and other data, identifying potential issues and ensuring the accuracy and validity of the information. Additionally, manual review will be employed to confirm the quality of the uploaded data. Publicly available training materials will be provided to educate users on the correct reporting methods to reduce false or inaccurate information.\nEpidemic Data Management and Analysis:   The Admin-Portal will aggregate data from the User-Portal (e.g., breeding site locations, case distributions, transmission trends) and generate real-time dengue fever epidemic heat maps, displaying the epidemic’s development. Data can be filtered by time range, geographical location, case type, etc., and the system will update the map in real time, helping decision-makers assess risk areas and epidemic trends.\nRapid Response and Intervention:  Based on the epidemic heat map and risk assessment, the system will identify and flag high-risk epidemic areas. It will automatically generate targeted control recommendations for specific areas to assist public health departments in decision-making. When the system detects potential epidemic hotspots or abnormal data, it will trigger an alert to notify the relevant departments for timely investigation.\nReal-Time Health Communication:  The Admin-Portal integrates with social media platforms, enabling information dissemination on mainstream social media sites. Every posted update regarding the epidemic, control measures, or health education will be synchronized across multiple platforms. This will encourage information flow and public engagement. Users can also interact with posts, such as commenting and liking, enhancing the impact of prevention and control efforts.\n\n\nThe core feature of the system is to enhance the automation of health communication through intelligent services while providing personalized health advice and alert information to the public. The system will ensure real-time data updates, establish a rapid response mechanism, and support bidirectional information flow and interactive feedback. It will be updated iteratively to adapt to the epidemic prevention needs of different regions and various infectious diseases in the future."
